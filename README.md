# üöÄ Intelligent Document Analyzer (Day 1 of 30-Day AI Project Challenge)

## Overview

This is a functional **End-to-End (E2E) AI application** designed to analyze PDF documents. It demonstrates core skills in web development, backend API creation, document handling, and secure Large Language Model (LLM) integration.

The application allows a user to upload a PDF, which is processed by a Python/Flask backend. The text is extracted, sent to the Gemini API, and the resulting structured summary and key insights are displayed in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Technology Stack

This project is divided into a frontend UI and a robust Python backend, communicating via a REST API.

### Backend & AI Components (Python / Flask)

| Component | Technology / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Server** | **Flask** | Lightweight REST API to handle file uploads and serve the HTML page. |
| **AI Integration** | **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) | Used for high-quality summarization and extraction of key takeaways. |
| **Document Parsing** | **`pypdf`** | Extracts raw text content from the binary PDF file stream efficiently. |
| **Configuration** | **`python-dotenv`** | Safely loads the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` locally from the untracked `.env` file. |
| **Security** | **Environment Variables** | API keys are secured via Vercel Secrets in production, never hardcoded. |
| **Limits** | **32MB Max File Size** | Configured in `app.py` and `vercel.json` to handle larger documents. |

### Frontend Components (E2E User Experience)

| Feature | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UI/UX** | **HTML5 & Custom CSS** | Clean, modern design with a responsive layout. |
| **Interactivity** | **Vanilla JavaScript** | Handles file selection, submits data via `fetch()` (AJAX), and updates the results dynamically. |
| **File Handling** | **`FormData`** | Manages the file upload process to the Flask API. |

## üíª Local Setup and Run Instructions

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/intelligent-document-analyzer.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/intelligent-document-analyzer.git)
cd intelligent-document-analyzer
````

### 2\. Setup Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

# Install dependencies from the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Configure API Key

To keep your sensitive information secret, you must use a `.env` file for local development.

1.  Create a file named **`.env`** in the root of your project directory:
    ```ini
    # .env - Do NOT commit this file to GitHub!
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" 
    ```
2.  Paste your actual Gemini API key as the value.

### 4\. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Guide (Vercel)

This project is configured for seamless deployment via Vercel's Git integration.

1.  **Repository Setup:** Ensure the public repository is clean (no `.env` or `venv` folder).
2.  **Vercel Import:** Log in to Vercel, click "Add New Project," and import this GitHub repository.
3.  **Configuration:** Vercel will auto-detect the configuration via the `vercel.json` file.
4.  **Add Secret Key (CRITICAL):**
      * During the Vercel project setup (or later in the project settings), navigate to **Environment Variables**.
      * Add a new variable:
          * **Name:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
          * **Value:** Paste your actual secret API key.
          * **Environments:** Select `Production` and `Preview`.
5.  **Deploy\!** Vercel will build the project and make it live on a unique URL.
